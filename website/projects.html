<h3>Golden Orb (Senior High Project)</h3>
<h3>Fighting game project made in the M.U.G.E.N. game engine. I served as the group leader, <br> I drew the sprites and background, and binded the controls. The rest edited the sprites for usability and added music. <br> The mechanics of the game however is the default game mechanics of M.U.G.E.N. <br> we didn't change the physics or math in the game, we just coded in our own original characters.</h3>
